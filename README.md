# C Learning Journey

This repository documents my journey learning the C programming language. It contains various projects and exercises ranging from simple calculations to more complex systems.

## Projects

### 1. Pharmacy Drug Tracking System (Algoritme Projesi)

A console-based application to track pharmacy inventory.

- **Features**: Add drugs, list stock, simulated barcode generation, file persistence.
- **Location**: `Algoritme Projesi/`

### 2. Grade Average Calculator (notortalma)

A simple program to calculate grade averages.

- **Location**: `notortalma/notort.c`

### 3. Age Calculator (yas)

A basic utility to calculate age based on input or birth year.

- **Location**: `yas/yas.c`

### 4. Average Difference (ortfark)

A program related to calculating differences in averages.

- **Location**: `ortfark/ortfark.c`

### 5. General C Exercises (C projects)

The `C projects` directory contains various small exercises, experiments, and code snippets created during the learning process.

### 6. Sales Tracking System (final_practice)

A console-based application to track product sales.

- **Features**: Add new sales (product name and price), view sales history, persistent storage in text file.
- **Location**: `final_practice/main.c`

## Getting Started

To run any of these projects, you will need a C compiler like `gcc`.

### How to Compile and Run

1.  **Open a terminal** in the specific project directory.
2.  **Compile** the source code:
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o outputname
    ```
3.  **Run** the executable:
    - On Windows: `.\outputname.exe`
    - On macOS/Linux: `./outputname`

### Example (Running the Grade Calculator)

```bash
cd notortalma
gcc notort.c -o notort
.\notort.exe
```
